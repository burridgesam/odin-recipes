        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An egg-free cookie dough recipe sourced from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/255365/edible-cookie-dough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allrecipes.com</a>.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>½ cup milk chocolate chips</li>
            <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To heat-treat your flour so it is safe to use: Place flour in a microwave-safe dish and cook for 1 minute and 15 seconds, stirring it every 15 seconds. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in vanilla extract and salt. Add heat-treated flour; mix until a crumbly dough forms. Stir in milk until dough is just combined; fold in milk chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>There is a potential risk of foodborne illness from the consumption of raw flour. Follow Step 1 to heat-treat your flour so it is safe to use. If you do not have a microwave, spread flour out on a baking sheet and toast in an oven at 350 degrees F for 5 to 6 minutes.</p>
